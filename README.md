# 100_Day_Python

These are the projects I am working on through a 100 Day Python Course.

Most projects will be done with no reference to solutions and will use my own code. Notes will likely be included
in my code where I could have improved or simplified my code as I learn. This means that these projects may not
be solved optimally. They are a learning tool.
