# 100 Day Python Journey

These are the projects I am working on through a 100 Day Python Course.
Each day will be added as I go, with some additional updates as I work
and improve particular projects. This course is being used to help me
learn Python and apply lessons to build specific projects that utilize
new learned concepts. Some additional notes about this:

1. This repo was created on Day 9 to keep up to date and work on the
project from multiple devices. From Day 9 onwards, the repo will be kept
up to date in real time as projects are completed.

2. Some days there may not be an update in the repo. This will occur if
I happen to skip a day due to time constraints or because of some other
unforseen circumstance (illness, holiday, etc). This may also happen if
I get stuck on a particular project and work on it over multiple days.
However, I will be attempting to try and complete each day in the course 
on a daily basis as consistently as possible.

3. I will be attempting to do most of these projects on my own without referencing 
any solutions presented in the course. This is a way of helping me learn to solve
problems building specific applications on my own without outside help. However, I
will of course be utilizing outside resources throughout the course should
I forget how to implement something specific.

4. It is likely that many projects may not be coded in the most optimal way.
This is due to one of three reasons:
    a. I didn't think of a better solution at the time
    b. I was encouraged to build an application using only concepts I
    had learned already
    c. I hadn't learned a better way to implement something at that point
When this is the case, it is possible I may go back and adjust code in
the future should I feel like improving certain applications.
