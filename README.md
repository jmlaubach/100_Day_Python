# 100_Day_Python

These are the projects I am working on through a 100 Day Python Course. Some days may be skipped depending on
time availability and holidays.

Note that this repo will be kept up to date from Day 9 onward, as it was 
created starting from Day 9.

Most projects will be done with no reference to solutions and will use my own code. Notes will likely be included
in my code where I could have improved or simplified my code as I learn. This means that these projects may not
be solved optimally. They are a learning tool.
